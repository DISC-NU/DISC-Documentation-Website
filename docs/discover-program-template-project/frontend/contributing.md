## Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one code owner
- All CI/CD checks must pass before merging
- Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed

## Code Owners

The following maintainers are responsible for reviewing changes:

```bash
# Default owners for all files
* @ethanpaneraa @amyzliao @aanandp123
```

All pull requests must be approved by at least one code owner before merging.

## Coding Standards

### File Organization

- Place new components in appropriate directories under `src/`
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Follow the established project structure

### Component Guidelines

- Use `.jsx` extension for files containing JSX
- Define PropTypes for all props
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic

### Code Style

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use proper import ordering:
  1. React imports
  2. Third-party modules
  3. Absolute paths from `src/`
  4. Relative paths
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise comments

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format

Use clear, descriptive titles that explain the change:

```bash
feat: add user profile component
fix: resolve navigation bug
docs: update installation guide
style: improve button styling
```

### PR Description
