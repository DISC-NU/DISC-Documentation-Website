# DISCover Program Template Project

Welcome to the DISCover Program Template Project documentation! This template serves as the foundation for all web applications developed during the DISC Discover Program, ensuring consistency and quality across team projects.

## Overview

The DISCover Program Template Project provides a standardized web application structure that combines modern technologies and best practices. It consists of two main components:

- **Frontend Template**: A React-based application template with pre-configured routing, styling, and authentication
- **Backend Template**: An Express.js server template with database integration, authentication, and API scaffolding

## Why a Standard Template?

This template was created to:

- Ensure consistent development practices across all Discover Program teams
- Reduce initial setup time for new projects
- Provide a solid foundation with industry-standard tools and practices
- Make it easier for tech leads to support multiple teams effectively

## Tech Stack

Our template uses a modern JavaScript/TypeScript stack:

### Frontend

- React for UI components
- React Router v7 for navigation
- styled-components for styling
- Supabase for authentication

### Backend

- Node.js and Express for the server
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for database
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

### Development Tools

- Git for version control
- VS Code as the recommended editor
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Getting Started

To begin working with the template, you'll find detailed documentation for both the frontend and backend components in their respective sections. Each section includes:

- Setup instructions
- Project structure overview
- Development guidelines
- Code style requirements

Select either the Frontend or Backend section from the sidebar to get started with development.
