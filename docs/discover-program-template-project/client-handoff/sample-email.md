Hi [Client Name],

I hope you’re doing well! On behalf of the Discover Program team, I’m excited to share the final hand-off package for **[Project Name]**. Below you’ll find a concise recap, all access links, and suggested next steps.

### Project Recap and Overview

- **Goal:**: Based on the original conversations during the winter, our goal for this project was the following: [two/three sentence description of the orignal project goal here].

- **Core functionality delivered:** After the duration of the program, we were able to get all of the main core functionalities completed: [Brief list of key features or workflows]

- **Current status:** [“MVP complete,” “Beta,” “v1.0,” etc.] – demoed at last week’s showcase

### Project Deliverables and Access

The following details some of the important documents and places where all of our work is stored. You are free to take any of this and we will be providing you all of the neccessary login credentials needed to access some of the more private areas. All of the internal code is stored publicy on Github. You are more than welcome to make the internal code private if you would like too.

Here are the links:

- **Specification Sheet:**

  - [Link to your frontend spec sheet here]
  - [Link to your backend spec sheet here]

  _make sure that both spec sheets have access permissions to be viewed by anyone with the link or share directly with your clients!_

- **Source code:** GitHub repo – [https://github.com/YourOrg/ProjectRepo](https://github.com/YourOrg/ProjectRepo)

  - We will be giving you the login/signin credentials to the specifcic Github account that we created for the program. You can change the associated Github Email on your own.

- **Design files:** Figma project – _Project-Name-FINAL_ (**make sure that the link is set to “Anyone with the link – can view”**).

- **Documentation:** Google Drive folder – _/Client-Hand-off/_ (user guide, architecture doc, meeting notes).

- **Demo recording:** Loom – [https://loom.com/share/abc123](https://loom.com/share/abc123) (12-minute walkthrough with timestamps). **More on this later**.

- **Credentials:** [Secure doc or vault link]. Please rotate these credentials at your earliest convenience.

Feel free to reply if any of these links don’t work or if you need additional permissions.

### Next Steps & Maintenance

1. **Open issues:** We documented three items in GitHub labeled `future-work` (performance tuning, dark-mode styling, automated backups).

2. **Deployment:** Refer to _Deploy.md_ in the repo for the deployment process/pipeline.

3. **Ownership:** We recommend assigning a primary owner in your team/organanization to monitor the status of the Project on Vercel/Github/Supabase to make sure that none of the services go to "sleep".

### Support Window

Our team is happy to answer quick questions via email or a 15-minute call until **June 20, 2025**. After that date, the Northwestern DISC tech leads will be your main point of contact.

Please let us know once you’ve verified access to everything above. When you confirm, we’ll mark the project as officially handed off and revoke our elevated permissions.

Thank you for partnering with the Discover Program this quarter—we’ve loved working on **[Project Name]** and look forward to seeing it grow!
