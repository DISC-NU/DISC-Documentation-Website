# Introduction

Welcome to the Discover Program off-boarding guide!
This short handbook explains **everything your project team needs to do this week** to hand off your work to the client and officially wrap up the quarter.

## Why This Guide Exists

- **Consistency** – Every client receives the same clear, professional package.
- **Continuity** – Future DISC teams (and your client) can pick up where you left off.
- **Closure** – You get full credit once we see the hand-off email with `disc@u.northwestern.edu` CC’d.

## Who Should Read This

- **Discover project team members** preparing their final deliverables
- **Tech leads & DISC staff** reviewing off-boarding status
- **Clients** looking for a reference after the hand-off call

## Quick Start

1. **Skim the _Checklist Overview_** – know exactly what must be done.
2. **Draft your client email** using the provided template.
3. **Package & upload** all assets; verify permissions.
4. **Record a walkthrough** (strongly encouraged).
5. **Send the email** (CC `disc@u.northwestern.edu`) and await client confirmation.
6. **Revoke personal access** and notify tech leads once the client accepts.

## Need Help?

- Post questions in **#tech-leads** on Discord.
- Email **disc@u.northwestern.edu** for anything urgent.

Let’s finish strong—good luck with finals and thanks for making this year’s Discover projects a success!
