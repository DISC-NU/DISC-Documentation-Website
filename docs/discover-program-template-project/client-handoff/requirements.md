**FINAL ACTION ITEMS FOR DISCOVER TEAMS**

I hope you guys had a good weekend and happy final weeks! Here are some of the last things that tech leads want you guys to complete to officially off-board from the Discover program! **Please make sure to read all of these instructions in full**.**Your deadline to complete this is the end of the week (this Friday)**. At least one person needs to do this, so you can all decide who has the capacity to do this amongst your teams.

## Discover Program Project Team Offloading

### Write an email to your client for hand-off

**What I think you should include in these emails:**

1. **Project recap (3-5 sentences).** Summarize the original goal, the core functionality you built, and the current state (did you complete your MVP? Is the project considered "beta", version 1 shipped?).

2. **Deliverables list.** Bullet out every asset you’re handing over (repo link, design files, datasets, credentials, user guide, slide decks, etc.).

3. **Access instructions.** Clarify where everything lives (GitHub, Figma, Google Drive, etc.) and list the exact permissions the client needs to view, edit, or deploy.

4. **Next steps / maintenance.** Note any open issues, nice-to-have features, or known bugs. Recommend who should own future work (client dev, IT team, a future Discover program group).

5. **Support window.** Offer a short support period (e.g., “We’ll be available for quick questions until June 20”). **It's okay if you say that you can't support the project anymore**. Tech leads will figure out the next steps when it comes to that.

> **Remember:** CC **`disc@u.northwestern.edu`** so we have a record—no CC means it didn’t happen! **You must do this so we have record that you have off-loaded your project!!**.

### 2. Package & transfer every project asset

| Asset                     | Where to store                                                                                                     | Final checks                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source code**           | GitHub repo (transfer ownership or add client as admin)                                                            | `README.md` has build/run steps                                                                                      |
| **Designs & mock-ups**    | Figma → “Project-Name-FINAL” folder                                                                                | All frames named & grouped, share link set to “Anyone with the link – can view”                                      |
| **Docs & diagrams**       | Google Drive → `/Client-Hand-off/` or something like that. Or if not Google Drive, whatever else your client uses. | “Getting Started” & “Quick Start". You should already have this done though.                                         |
| **Credentials / secrets** | Somewhere secure/semi-secure, Google Docs maybe?                                                                   | **MAKE SURE THAT 1- YOUR CREDENTIALS WORK AND 2- THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED THEM DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEM ANYMORE** |

_My advice_: Try to do another walkthrough of your project, to make sure that things haven't broken since the showcase last Monday.

_you might also want to rotate your credentials (getting new ones) depending on your project_.

### 3. Finalize documentation if you haven't already

1. **README**: Update install commands, environment variables, and any setup quirks/common issues.

2. **CHANGELOG**: Add a final entry — `[v1.0] – 2025-06-13 - Final client release`.

3. **Issue/Tasks board**: Close done items, label anything left as `future-work`, assign to “Client”.

4. **Documentation Website (Optiona)**: Add in a page somewhere in the documentation website to include links to presentations, past meeting notes, demos, etc etc.

**This is the living knowledge base that your client, DISC, and future Discover Program participants will be using so PLEASE make this as clean, easy to navigate, and detailed as possible**.

---

### 4. Record or host a walkthrough (strongly encouraged)

- record a **Loom / Zoom** demo (10-15 min) and link it in both the email and README.

---

### 5. Confirm completion & access revocation

1. Wait for the client to reply “All set!” (or similar) **and** verify they can open all links.

2. Remove your personal access to client resources if requested (GitHub, Gmail accounts, etc.).

3. Send a message to Tech Leads that your client has accepted the hand-off of the project.
